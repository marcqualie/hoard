# Storage Engine for Event based Data

Hoard is currently a prototype for logging event based data. It's currently in early alpha testing, and not suitable for production.

**Update:** I am currently extremely busy with work right now so I won't be concentrating on Hoard as much as I'd like. I will be putting my focus more into the next version, which will be rebuilt from the ground up with a different architetural goal in mind. Feel free to fork this version and stay tuned for my next projects.
